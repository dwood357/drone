abstract = {<p>Altitude and attitude controlled quadcopter model is used for the behavior and control algorithm testing, before the implementation on the experimental setup. The main objective is the control system design which will achieve good task performance in the combination with the quadcopter dynamic model. Also, for the control model, it is important to be relatively easy to modify for the use of other control algorithms and to be easy to implement on the experimental setup. At the beginning of this article, the control system design process is described. Quadcopter dynamics equations are simplified by applying several assumptions and in that form are used for the controller synthesis. Quadcopter control system is split into inner and outer control loop because the quadcopter is underactuated system which means that the direct control of all of the degrees of freedom is not possible. In the second part, the PI-D control algorithm is described which is applied on the simplified quadcopter...},

abstract = {<p>The research on aerial manipulation has increased rapidly in recent years. In the previous work, a manipulator or a gripper is attached to the bottom of a quadrotor to facilitate the interaction with the environment. However, the previously introduced systems suffer from either limited end-effector degrees of freedom (DOF) or small payload capacity. In this paper, a quadrotor with a 2-DOF manipulator that has a unique topology to enable the end-effector to track a desired 6-DOF trajectory with minimum possible actuators is investigated. The proposed system is designed and modeled. However, such a system produces complexity in its inverse kinematics and control. A novel solution to the inverse kinematics problem is presented, which requires a solution of complicated algebraic/differential equations. Its accuracy is verified via numerical results. In order to solve the control problem, the system nonholonomic constraints are utilized with a model-free and low computation cost robust control technique. Moreover, the system stability proof under the proposed controller is carried out. A prototype of the proposed system is built and its design is verified via a flight test. In addition, the system feasibility and efficiency are enlightened.</p>},

abstract = {<p>Mathematical model of an unmanned aerial vehicle with four propulsors (quadcopter) is indispensable in quadcopter movement simulation and later modelling of the control algorithm. Mathematical model is, at the same time, the first step in comprehending the mathematical principles and physical laws which are applied to the quadcopter system. The objective is to define the mathematical model which will describe the quadcopter behavior with satisfactory accuracy and which can be, with certain modifications, applicable for the similar configurations of multirotor aerial vehicles. At the beginning of mathematical model derivation, coordinate systems are defined and explained. By using those coordinate systems, relations between parameters defined in the earth coordinate system and in the body coordinate system are defined. Further, the quadcopter kinematic is described which enables setting those relations. Also, quadcopter dynamics is used to introduce forces and torques to the model...},

abstract = {<p>This paper introduces a new quadrotor manipulation system that consists of a 2-link manipulator attached to the bottom of a quadrotor. This new system presents a solution for the drawbacks found in the current quadrotor manipulation system which uses a gripper fixed to a quadrotor. Unlike the current system, the proposed system enables the end-effector to achieve any arbitrary orientation and thus increases its degrees of freedom from 4 to 6. Also, it provides enough distance between the quadrotor and the object to be manipulated. This is useful in some applications such as demining applications. System kinematics and dynamics are derived which are highly nonlinear. Controller is designed based on feedback linearization to track desired trajectories. Controlling the movements in the horizontal directions is simplified by utilizing the derived nonholonmic constraints. Finally, the proposed system is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK program. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.</p>},

abstract = {This technical note introduces the design of sliding mode control algorithms for nonlinear systems in the presence of hard inequality constraints on both control and state variables. Relying on general results on minimum-time higher-order sliding mode for unconstrained systems, a general order control law is formulated to robustly steer the state to the origin, while satisfying all the imposed constraints. Results on minimum-time convergence to the sliding manifold, as well as on the maximization of the domain of attraction, are analytically proved for the first-order and second-order sliding mode cases. A general result is presented regarding the domain of attraction in the general order case, while numerical results on the estimation of the domain of attraction and on minimum-time convergence are discussed for the third-order case, following a procedure applicable to a sliding mode of any order.},

abstract = {In this paper, a fault-tolerant control method is proposed for quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to account for system uncertainties and actuator faults. A mathematical model of the quadcopter UAV is first introduced when faults occur in actuators. A normal adaptive sliding mode control (NASMC) approach is proposed as a baseline controller to handle the chattering problem and system uncertainties, which does not require information of the upper bound. To improve the performance of the NASMC scheme, radial basis function neural networks are combined with an adaptive scheme to make a quick compensation in presence of system uncertainties and actuator faults. The Lyapunov theory is applied to verify the stability of the proposed methods. The effectiveness of modified ASMC algorithm is compared with that of NASMC using numerical examples under different faulty conditions.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the chattering problem in sliding mode control is one of the most important points to consider in real-time applications. To address this problem, a real-time robust altitude control scheme is proposed for the efficient performance of a Quad-rotor aircraft system using a continuous sliding mode control. The sensing of altitude measurement sensing is performed by a pressure sensor in order to obtain a robust altitude control of the vehicle in hovering mode both indoor and outdoor. The altitude measurement has the advantage of introducing this state information directly in the closed loop control which should be very useful for achieving robust stabilization of the altitude control. Accordingly, we propose a sliding mode control strategy without chattering. The sliding mode control proposed removes the chattering phenomenon by replacing a sign function with a high-slope saturation function. The control algorithm is derived from the Lyapunov stability theorem. Moreover, we have assumed that the actuators are able to respond quickly and accurately and we have not enforced limits on the control signals for a real-time application. Finally, to verify the satisfactory performance of proposed nonlinear control law, several simulations and experimental results of the Chattering-free sliding mode control for the Quad-rotor aircraft in the presence of bounded disturbances are presented.},

abstract = {In order to improve the control performance of the transport vehicle, the dynamic model, instead of the kinematic model, is established. The equation of state can be divided into two independent subsystems: the speed sub system and the attitude angle sub system. The sliding mode controls based on the dynamic model are designed for the two subsystems to reduce the complexity of the overall system, and the armature voltages of the motors are used as the control inputs of the system of the transport vehicle. The disturbances, for instance the fluctuations in the power supply, are considered, so the control law has robustness to the external disturbances. Simulation results show that the control method can control the transport vehicle to move according to the desired signals, and the validity of the method can be proved.},
