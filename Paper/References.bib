abstract = {<p>Altitude and attitude controlled quadcopter model is used for the behavior and control algorithm testing, before the implementation on the experimental setup. The main objective is the control system design which will achieve good task performance in the combination with the quadcopter dynamic model. Also, for the control model, it is important to be relatively easy to modify for the use of other control algorithms and to be easy to implement on the experimental setup. At the beginning of this article, the control system design process is described. Quadcopter dynamics equations are simplified by applying several assumptions and in that form are used for the controller synthesis. Quadcopter control system is split into inner and outer control loop because the quadcopter is underactuated system which means that the direct control of all of the degrees of freedom is not possible. In the second part, the PI-D control algorithm is described which is applied on the simplified quadcopter...},

abstract = {<p>The research on aerial manipulation has increased rapidly in recent years. In the previous work, a manipulator or a gripper is attached to the bottom of a quadrotor to facilitate the interaction with the environment. However, the previously introduced systems suffer from either limited end-effector degrees of freedom (DOF) or small payload capacity. In this paper, a quadrotor with a 2-DOF manipulator that has a unique topology to enable the end-effector to track a desired 6-DOF trajectory with minimum possible actuators is investigated. The proposed system is designed and modeled. However, such a system produces complexity in its inverse kinematics and control. A novel solution to the inverse kinematics problem is presented, which requires a solution of complicated algebraic/differential equations. Its accuracy is verified via numerical results. In order to solve the control problem, the system nonholonomic constraints are utilized with a model-free and low computation cost robust control technique. Moreover, the system stability proof under the proposed controller is carried out. A prototype of the proposed system is built and its design is verified via a flight test. In addition, the system feasibility and efficiency are enlightened.</p>},

abstract = {This work is the design of the robust attitude stabilization of a quadrotor. The dynamics model of the quadrotor is normally non-linear and it is difficult to obtain an accurate dynamic model. The linearized model is obtained based on data from experiments. The Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) state variable feedback control is implemented to stabilize the system. The dynamic model based on approximated torques (roll, pitch, and yaw) as inputs and the dynamic model based on rotational speeds of the four rotors are used for design the controller. The experimental results from both dynamic model has very similar characteristic and perform much better than the conventional controller.},

abstract = {<p>Mathematical model of an unmanned aerial vehicle with four propulsors (quadcopter) is indispensable in quadcopter movement simulation and later modelling of the control algorithm. Mathematical model is, at the same time, the first step in comprehending the mathematical principles and physical laws which are applied to the quadcopter system. The objective is to define the mathematical model which will describe the quadcopter behavior with satisfactory accuracy and which can be, with certain modifications, applicable for the similar configurations of multirotor aerial vehicles. At the beginning of mathematical model derivation, coordinate systems are defined and explained. By using those coordinate systems, relations between parameters defined in the earth coordinate system and in the body coordinate system are defined. Further, the quadcopter kinematic is described which enables setting those relations. Also, quadcopter dynamics is used to introduce forces and torques to the model...},

abstract = {<p>This paper introduces a new quadrotor manipulation system that consists of a 2-link manipulator attached to the bottom of a quadrotor. This new system presents a solution for the drawbacks found in the current quadrotor manipulation system which uses a gripper fixed to a quadrotor. Unlike the current system, the proposed system enables the end-effector to achieve any arbitrary orientation and thus increases its degrees of freedom from 4 to 6. Also, it provides enough distance between the quadrotor and the object to be manipulated. This is useful in some applications such as demining applications. System kinematics and dynamics are derived which are highly nonlinear. Controller is designed based on feedback linearization to track desired trajectories. Controlling the movements in the horizontal directions is simplified by utilizing the derived nonholonmic constraints. Finally, the proposed system is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK program. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.</p>},

abstract = {<p>Quadrotor helicopters have become increasingly important in recent years as platforms for both research and commercial unmanned aerial vehicle applications. This paper extends previous work on several important aerodynamic effects impacting quadrotor flight in regimes beyond nominal hover conditions. The implications of these effects on quadrotor performance are investigated and control techniques are presented that compensate for them accordingly. The analysis and control systems are validated on the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control quadrotor helicopter testbed by performing the quadrotor equivalent of the stall turn aerobatic maneuver. Flight results demonstrate the accuracy of the aerodynamic models and improved control performance with the proposed control schemes.</p>},
